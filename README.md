# JODConverter Ex (Extended, Extra, E'x'cetera)

I created this fork because I had to do some changes to the original project and I want to share my work with the community.

In order to be able to apply changes to the JODConverter project, I had to understand the source code first. So, for those who may have take a look at the original source code, you'll be happy to see a lot more comments in this version. I tried to be as meaningful as possible along the way, but comments (about the comments!) are always welcome. Please note that my first language is not English.

## What you want to know...

- **SIGAR**: This fork does not depend on SIGAR.

- **Dependencies**: The core project of this fork depends on slf4j, commons-lang3, commons-io, and the required LibreOffice libraries (for now, everything seems to work nice with OpenOffice too).

- **Tests**: This fork has been tested only on Windows.

- **What's next**: I'm still on learning mode, but my goals are to:
	- Add some filters in order to be able to add text, images, and whatever we are able to change while converting a document.
	- Improve project comments.
	- Switch to Gradle instead of Maven.
	- Switch to JUnit (since the new spring-boot module).
	- Use the great SonarQube platform for code quality.
	- Add tests.
	- Fix reported bugs (will always be the priority).
	- Take a look at [Oshi](https://github.com/oshi/oshi) for processes management (SIGAR replacement). Seems promising... (Advice and comments always welcome).
	- Improve the sample-webapp project.
	- Have fun!

## Thanks To...

I cannot say exactly where you could find some similitude between my source code and the one of these forks I tried to use before I created my own but here are my favorite/inspiration forks:

- [XWiki fork](https://github.com/xwiki/jodconverter): Nice choice if you can afford using the SIGAR tools (which I couldn't sadly).
- [Nuxeo fork](https://github.com/nuxeo/jodconverter): Nice choice if you don't want to use SIGAR and don't came across an unresponsive office process following a timeout exception that drives you crazy.

### A special thanks to:
The dude who created a pull request in these two forks with a stress test that made my office process to crash every times! I cannot named him because I don't know him but my first commit was when I was able to build my things with his stress test on!!  

## Building the Project

```Shell
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

## Original JODConverter

JODConverter (Java OpenDocument Converter) automates document conversions using LibreOffice or OpenOffice.org.
